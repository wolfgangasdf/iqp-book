# Overview

*Introduction to Quantum Physics* gives you a compact introduction to quantum mechanics, intended as part of the homologation module of the **Leiden/Delft MSc programme Quantum Information Science and Technology QIST**.

To gain most from this course:
* watch the videos (next to brightspace [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/3o7NIf6XENYnvyH)). Due to reordering, some chapter numbers in the videos are different to the book here.
* read this book. There is also a PDF version: [iqp-book.pdf](iqp-book.pdf).
* do the brightspace quizzes.
* solve the exercise assignments - alone or in a group, don't look at solutions unless you are really stuck!
* during all this, collect questions for the workgroup sessions, and possibly read a bit more in Griffiths.

## Prerequisites

We assume that you are familiar with:

- Differential and integral calculus
- Infinite series
- Complex numbers and complex functions
- The course [Mathematics for Quantum Physics](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~bruinpj/MQP/)

## Notational conventions

* We often leave out the arrow on top of vectors. Whether a variable is a vector or a scalar should be clear from the context. The same holds for the hat on operators.

## What is missing?

* Magnetic resonance, only basics.
* The variational principle (Griffiths 8)
* Molecules
* Scattering theory (Griffiths 10)
* Large parts of quantum electrodynamics, for instance the [Aharonov–Bohm effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharonov%E2%80%93Bohm_effect).
* Fermi’s Golden Rule (G11.3)
* Stimulated and spontaneous emission, absorption

## Comments and contributing

Everything is welcome!
