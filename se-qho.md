# The quantum harmonic oscillator

In this section we discuss a slightly different potential than the square-well potential: the quadratic or harmonic potential. This is a key model system of quantum mechanics, where we also introduce the concepts of excitations and ladder operators. It is extremely important because harmonic potential appear at many places in physics including even quantum optics!

## Harmonic potentials

{{slidetag}}
<!-- [Sakurai 2.3] [Griffiths 2.3] -->

The harmonic oscillator is as it is in classical mechanics, one of the most important systems in quantum mechanics – because it appears everywhere in nature, and it is simple enough to solve it analytically and highlights many of the basic concepts and methods of quantum mechanics. It appears everywhere in nature because nearly any potential landscape can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator, from optical systems over molecular vibrations to the dynamics of nuclear particles. 

The paradigm for a classical one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is a mass $m$ at position $x$ attached to a spring of force constant $k$. The motion, we ignore friction, is governed by Hooke’s law, $F=-kx=m\ddot{x}$, and the solution is $x(t)=A\sin(\omega t)+B\cos(\omega t)$, where $k\equiv m\omega^2$ is the (angular) frequency of the oscillation. 

We can express the force of the spring in a potential function depending on the spring extension $x$, and we find a parabolic shape of the potential energy $V(x)=kx^2/2$.

Note that in nature, there is no perfect harmonic oscillator — Hooke’s law does only approximately apply, and there are often many technical issues, e.g. a spring breaks if it is extended too far. But practically any potential is approximately parabolic in the neighbourhood of a local minimum – this can be seen from a Taylor expansion of any potential around a minimum:

$$
V(x)=V\left(x_0\right)+V^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)+\frac{1}{2} V^{\prime \prime}\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)^2+\cdots

## A Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator

{{slidetag}}

For a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, we need to solve the Schrödinger equation for the potential

$$
V(x)=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2
$$(se-qho-v2)

Here we have eliminated the spring constant using the relation between spring constant, mass, and frequency:

$$
\omega \equiv \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
$$(se-qho-v3)
 
We can again split off the time dependent part and we obtain for the time-independent Schrödinger equation: 

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2\psi=E\psi 
$$(se-qho-v4)


Solving this differential equation means finding the Eigenfunctions $\Psi$ and corresponding energies $E$. This can be done by looking up the solution for this particular differential equation in a mathematics book. We will use another approach that is also done by Griffiths (section 2.3.1) and introduce a very important algebraic technique: The so-called ladder or creation and annihilation operators - which create and annihilate quantum excitations in quantum systems.

## Ladder operators

{{slidetag}}

We can write the Schrödinger equation $H\psi=E\psi$ using the momentum operator as

$$
H=\frac{1}{2m}\left[p^2+(m\omega x)^2\right]
$$(se-qho-lo1)

The idea is now to factor this term, motivated by  and using some hindsight we can construct these composite operators involving the position and momentum operator:

$$
a_{ \pm} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \hbar m \omega}}(\mp i p+m \omega x)
$$(se-qho-lo2)

These are the so-called ladder operators, we will see soon why.

For the position and momentum operator we have the commutation relation

$$
[\hat{x}, \hat{p}]=i \hbar
$$(se-qho-lo3)

:::{note}
Show this!
:::

This is called a *canonical* commutation relation because it is of great fundamental importance. $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ are conjugate variables with non-zero commutator, which always leads to an uncertainty relation: it apparently matters if you first measure the position, and then the momentum of a particle or the other way around!


With this commutation relation, we obtain $\hat{a}_{-} \hat{a}_{+}=\frac{1}{\hbar \omega} \hat{H}+\frac{1}{2}$, or written differently

$$
H=\hbar \omega\left(\hat{a}_{+} \hat{a}_{-}+1 / 2\right)
$$(se-qho-lo4)

:::{note}
Exercise: show that $[a_-,a_+]=1$
:::

This is great! We have a Schrödinger equation that depends in a very simple form on operators, this must be useful. Now we will see that the ladder operators allow us to find the solutions.

{{slidetag}}

We now assume that some wavefunction $|\psi\rangle$ satisfies the Schrödinger equation with energy $E$, that is $H|\psi\rangle=E|\psi\rangle$.

Then we can calculate quite easily that 

$$
H\left(a_{+}|\psi\rangle\right)=(E+\hbar \omega)\left(a_{+}|\psi\rangle\right)
$$(se-qho-lo5)

where, apparently, $a_{+}$ has added $\hbar\omega$ to the energy of the system!

Similarly, we find that

$$
H\left(a_{-}|\psi\rangle\right)=(E-\hbar \omega)\left(a_{-}|\psi\rangle\right)
$$(se-qho-lo6)

So, $a_-$ lowers the energy of the system by $\hbar\omega$!

Therefore, $a_\pm$ are called "ladder operators", because they allow us to climb up and down in energy; $a_+$ is the raising operator, and $a_-$ is the lowering operator. As you can show, the hermitian conjugate of $a_-$ is $a_+$ and vice versa - therefore you often also read simply $a$ for $a_-$ and $a^\dagger$ for $a_+$. 

In the figure we show the action of the ladder operators, raising and lowering the energy of the system. Note you might already here see an important difference to the square well potential, here the energy levels are evenly spaces, while in the square well the energy scaled with the square of the state number.

## The ground state

{{slidetag}}

There has to be a catch, if we apply $a_-$ repeatedly we eventually will reach negative energies, which do not make sense - applying $a_-$ on the lowest-energy state which we call $\Psi_0$ should probably better result in "nothing":

$$
a_{-}\left|\psi_0\right\rangle=0
$$(se-qho-gs1)

The energy of the ground state $\Psi_0$ is $E_0=\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$ which can be easily be seen from the Schrödinger equation.

Now we can finally calculate an explicit wavefunction, working out $a_{-}\left|\psi_0\right\rangle=0$ results in the simple differential equation 

$$\frac{d \psi_0}{d x}=-\frac{m \omega}{\hbar} x \psi_0$$(se-qho-gs1a)

which can be solved by integration:

$$
\psi_0(x)=\left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1 / 4} e^{-\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar} x^2}
$$(se-qho-gs2)

This is a simple Gaussian distribution as shown in the figure, meaning that in the quantum ground state the probability to find the particle is highest at $x=0$ - this might still be intuitively explainable by classical thoughts - the particle is at rest. But you might remember that in quantum mechanics, a localized particle has a large momentum uncertainty so this is certainly not really at rest.

```{code-cell} ipython3

glue("qho-groundstate", fig, display=False)
```

(qho-groundstate)=
```{glue:figure} qho-groundstate

```

## Excited states

{{slidetag}}

Having the ground state energy and wave function, we can now find all excited states and energies by repeatedly applying the raising or creation operator $a^\dagger$:

$$
\psi_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n !}}\left(\hat{a}_{+}\right)^n \psi_0
$$(se-qho-es1)

We first find all energies:

$$
E_n=\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
$$(se-qho-es2)

This is very interesting and non-classical, and one of the most profound results of quantum mechanics: Even in case of no excitations, there is a non-zero energy in the system given by the $1/2$ term - in quantum mechanics, nothing can have zero energy.

The momentum operator in $a^\dagger$ basically leads to a spatial derivative of the previous state - resulting in the so-called Hermite functions $H_n$ with which the wave function becomes

$$
\psi_n(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n\,n!}}  \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4}  e^{
- \frac{m\omega x^2}{2 \hbar}} H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}} x \right), \qquad n = 0,1,2,\ldots.
$$(se-qho-es3)

In the first figure we show the first few solutions, but offsetted for better visibility - all wave functions oscillate around zero. 

In the second figure we show the  probability density of the same wave functions. We see different solutions with even and odd symmetry around $x=0$. This is very different to the classical case, it looks like quantum interference patterns here - classically, the probability density would always be highest at the turning points, which is here not the case.

Here we see a rather evenly distributed probability density. This is in strong contrast to the classical harmonic oscillator like a swing, where the probability is highest at the extremal turning points where the velocity is lowest. 

:::{admonition} Classical probability densities
:class: dropdown
Think about more differences concerning probability densities, like forbidden regions!
:::

As a side remark, we can construct special quantum states that most closely resemble classical motion in the harmonic oscillator, which are called *coherent states*. They are minimum-uncertainty states ($\Delta x \, \Delta p = \hbar/2$) and can be expressed as superpositions of many energy eigenstates $\Psi_n$. While a full discussion lies beyond the scope of this book, coherent states have many important applications, especially in laser physics and quantum optics, and related concepts appear in condensed matter systems such as superconductivity.

## Number states and number operator 

{{slidetag}}

Often, the states $|\Psi_n\rangle$ are written as $|n\rangle$, and are called *number states* or Fock states, which live in special Hilbert space called Fock space. They are called number states because the same system can be excited multiple times. We need to know how the ladder operators act on arbitrary number states, we obtain:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a^{\dagger}|n\rangle & =\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle \\
a|n\rangle & =\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle
\end{aligned}
$$(se-qho-ns1)

You might realize that this is pretty exciting: We can work with ladder operators and number states, for instance calculating eigenvalues or checking what is the ground state, without knowing exact solutions for the spatial wavefunction!

Another important operator in Fock space is the number operator:

$$
\begin{aligned}
N & = a^{\dagger} a \\
N|n\rangle & = n|n\rangle \\
\end{aligned}
$$(se-qho-ns2)

Its eigenvalue is simply $n$, the number of excitations.

:::{warning}
The number states are very different to the states $|H\rangle$, $|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$ etcetera which we discussed in the introduction - there, we always "had" a qubit or quantum state, and the ket vector described the state of the particular degree of freedom.

Number states are different, they describe the excitations of a particular system. They can describe an "empty" system without excitations , the ground state $n=0$, one excitation (like one photon!), two excitations (two photons!) and so on.

If we also want to make clear which particular internal state is meant, we use e.g. $|n_H\rangle$ - this would mean for instance $n$ photons with $H$ polarization. Make it always clear what you mean!
:::


## The need for anharmonicity

{{slidetag}}

I hope that with the harmonic oscillator we could introduce the basics of quantum mechanics to you. The harmonic oscillator appears everywhere in nature because every potential minimum has a quadratic term in the Taylor expansion. 

However, for making qubits for quantum computers, such harmonic potentials are actually not very useful: 

Assume that we want to use the number states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ to encode our qubit. For a useful qubit, we need to make the transition from state 0 to 1 - we now know that this can be done simply with the ladder operators, later we will see how microwave or optical fields often can do the job. 

But, since the spacing between all levels of a harmonic oscillator is equal, we will make the transition from 0 to 1, but immediately also from 1 to 2 and so on - we cannot selectively address transitions.

Therefore, in order to implement a qubit, we actually need to use an anharmonic oscillator as shown here with a quartic term added to the Hamiltonian

$$
H=\frac{\hat{p}^2}{2 m}+\frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2+\lambda x^4
$$(se-qho-ah1)

As shown in the figure, this lifts the so-called degeneracy of the energy levels, and we can make selective transitions between the states!

## Two quantizations

{{slidetag}}

You might have read that, historically, physicists talk about two so-called "quantizations" - now we can understand this.

The **first quantization** is the realization that we have to describe objects with (quantum) waves which were previously assumed to be particles. This holds clearly for atoms, electrons, neutrons, protons and so on. But for light, there was never the need for a first quantization since it was already considered to be a wave since Maxwell! 

But how do we get the quantum into light waves?

This is described by the **second quantization**, where wave fields also become quantized, for instance, by deriving a model where an electromagnetic field can be excited with a single photon. At the heart of this quantization is the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator that we have just studied, and it plays a central role in Quantum Field Theory (QFT). A quantum field (like the electromagnetic field) can be described as an infinite collection of independent quantum harmonic oscillators! In this model, the creation and annihilation operators you've already seen can be used to add or remove discrete energy packets and each of these packets is a single photon! You may see the creation and annihilation operators in many more places - expressing fields, particle states, and even defining Hamiltonians.

:::{note}
A monochromatic single-wavelength electromagnetic field can be quantized in a very similar way as the harmonic oscillator, because the electric and magnetic field of electromagnetic fields behave like the position and momentum of the harmonic oscillator. Therefore we get analog discrete excitations of the electromagnetic field, which are called photons.
:::

Currently, we think that the 2nd quantization is essential to build quantum machines which can bring about really exciting new technologies.
